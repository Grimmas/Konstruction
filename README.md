Konstruction
===

This is the repository for the USI Konstruction mod for [Kerbal Space Program](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com)

You can find the official repo for this mod on [Github](https://github.com/UmbraSpaceIndustries/Konstruction).  Releases, along with other USI products, can be found on [the USI Catalog Page](https://umbraspaceindustries.github.io/UmbraSpaceIndustries/).

### Download Link

You can download the current version of MKS from [the USI Catalog Page](https://umbraspaceindustries.github.io/UmbraSpaceIndustries/).  Note that for the sake of my own sanity, only the current release version is supported.
